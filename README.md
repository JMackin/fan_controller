A couple of computer-case fans hooked up to an arduino and temperature / humidity sensor. 

Two-button input to switch between and control manual operation and temperature-triggered auto-mode.

An arduino UNO controls a relay connected to a 12v power source for the fans.

Hardware features terrible soldering.
